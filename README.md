# [Project 2: Prediction Using Decision Tree Regression](https://github.com/NajihaAmira/DecisionTreeRegression)
1) Read the data that contain 205 data with 25 attributes  
2) Understand the data before proceed to next process
3) Proceed with data pre-processing include cleaning the data, replace null value with mean value
4) Figure out which attributes are highly correlated with the price, Turn out that 9 out of 25 attributes are highly correlated.
5) Do calculation accucracy for if all feature declare as independent variables and feature that only high correlated as independent variables to see the difference of value accuracy.
